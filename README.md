# Excel Date Cleaner
- We know that whenever we fetch data from any source we never get cleaned data. And so is the date values.
- Date can also come in different formats which can take a lot of our time to make them all in same format.
- So to get rid out of this problem, this tool is made. This will take up your date column and clean it in a proper format.


## What values this tool will accept?
It will accept:

## How to download this tool
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. If you download it, you receive its zip. In that case extract that zip file. If cloned then you get all files directly.
3. Now you will see 3 RAR files whch are splited. **You will need WinRAR or an RAR file decompressor tool so that you can decompress them.** I suggest to us WinRAR.
4. To decompress these files, just right-click the RAR file of 1st part and choose Extract To from the context menu. Then browse to the desired directory and click OK. This will extract all files in one go and will extract into a single folder.
5. Another way is to select all RAR files then right-click and choose Extract To and follow same as step 4. This will also do the same.
6. Now you have all the required files.
<br>Note that: None of the file should be missing from that extracted folder else the executable will not work.
